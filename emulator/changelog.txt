   -rewrote save settings function. Now i can consider that it's complete (there is one small bug left though).
   -Finally fixed the issue by cloning gamedrv.input_ports and then copying to Machine.input_ports .Now it seems to load correctly
   -Rewrote load config using java style. It seems to work from some tests i made. 
    Now from what i see the problem is that for some reason whatever goes to Machine.input_ports it also copies to Machine.gamedrv.input_ports so it can't be saved
    properly... I am looking at it..

11/07/2011

   -Implementing save and load of cfg files. save seems to work , but still there is a way for getting load to work proper as well

   -Fixed update_input_ports for the new inputs . It seems to work fine :) . No trakball support yet though..
   -Added the new input code from mame.c in mame.java . it seems to work as it should from debug but you never know until you test it :D
   -Added a special case in game constructor that checks if the new inputs is null before using macros. That way drivers that uses the old way can run too
   -Some intial works on newinput format. (basically i was trying to implement macros.Partially figure out how they should be done).Still a far way to go...

03/07/2011
----------

30/06/2011
----------
[Shadow] 
   -Almost all the new code in mame.c has been ported. Only missing the new input ports loading
